# Python Hangman Game

A typical Hangman game implemented in Python. This project features ASCII art for the hangman stages and a basic letter-guessing gameplay loop.

## Features
- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- Shows the hangman ASCII art that changes based on the player's remaining lives.
- Tracks guessed letters and prevents repeated guesses.
- Displays the progress of the word with underscores for unguessed letters.
- Ends the game with a win or lose message.

## How to Play
1. Run the code in a Python IDE .
2. Enter letters one by one to guess the hidden word.
3. You have 6 lives; each incorrect guess costs a life.
4. Guess all letters correctly before running out of lives to win.
